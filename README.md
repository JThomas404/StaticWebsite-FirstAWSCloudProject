## Technical Implementation

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions
- Custom domain name from registrar
- Basic understanding of DNS and web hosting concepts
- Static website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

### Phase 1: S3 Bucket Configuration

#### 1.1 Bucket Creation Strategy

```bash
# AWS CLI approach (recommended for automation)
aws s3 mb s3://quantumedge-com --region us-east-1
```

**Console Steps:**

1. Navigate to S3 service in AWS Console
2. Create bucket with domain-matching name: `quantumedge-com`
3. Select **us-east-1** region (required for Route 53 integration)
4. Enable versioning for rollback capabilities
5. Configure server access logging for analytics

#### 1.2 Security Configuration

- Block all public access initially
- Configure bucket policy for controlled public read access
- Enable MFA delete for production environments

### Phase 2: Content Deployment

#### 2.1 Automated Upload Process

```bash
# Sync local files to S3 with proper content types
aws s3 sync ./website s3://quantumedge-com --delete --cache-control max-age=31536000
```

#### 2.2 Content Optimisation

- Compress images and assets before upload
- Set appropriate cache headers for performance
- Implement gzip compression for text files
- Use content hashing for cache busting

#### 2.3 File Structure Best Practices

```
website/
├── index.html          # Main entry point
├── error.html          # Custom 404 page
├── assets/
│   ├── css/           # Stylesheets
│   ├── js/            # JavaScript files
│   └── images/        # Optimised images
└── robots.txt         # SEO configuration
```

### Phase 3: Static Website Configuration

#### 3.1 Website Hosting Setup

```bash
# Enable static website hosting via CLI
aws s3 website s3://quantumedge-com --index-document index.html --error-document error.html
```

#### 3.2 Production-Ready Bucket Policy

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::quantumedge-com/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "s3:ExistingObjectTag/Environment": "production"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3.3 Advanced Configuration

- Configure custom error pages for better UX
- Set up redirect rules for SEO optimisation
- Implement security headers via metadata

### Phase 4: DNS Management with Route 53

#### 4.1 Hosted Zone Creation

```bash
# Create hosted zone programmatically
aws route53 create-hosted-zone --name quantumedge.com --caller-reference $(date +%s)
```

#### 4.2 DNS Record Configuration

- **A Record**: Points domain to S3/CloudFront
- **AAAA Record**: IPv6 support for modern clients
- **MX Records**: Email routing (if applicable)
- **TXT Records**: Domain verification and SPF

#### 4.3 Health Checks & Monitoring

- Configure Route 53 health checks for uptime monitoring
- Set up CloudWatch alarms for DNS query failures
- Implement failover routing for high availability

### Phase 5: CloudFront CDN Implementation

#### 5.1 Distribution Configuration

```json
{
  "Origins": {
    "S3Origin": {
      "DomainName": "quantumedge-com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
      "CustomOriginConfig": {
        "HTTPPort": 80,
        "HTTPSPort": 443,
        "OriginProtocolPolicy": "http-only"
      }
    }
  },
  "DefaultCacheBehavior": {
    "ViewerProtocolPolicy": "redirect-to-https",
    "Compress": true,
    "CachePolicyId": "managed-caching-optimised"
  }
}
```

#### 5.2 Performance Optimisation

- Enable Gzip compression for 40% size reduction
- Configure cache behaviours for different content types
- Set appropriate TTL values for static assets
- Enable HTTP/2 for improved performance

#### 5.3 Security Enhancements

- Configure SSL/TLS certificates via ACM
- Implement security headers
- Enable AWS WAF for DDoS protection
- Set up origin access identity (OAI)

### Phase 6: Domain Integration

#### 6.1 DNS Record Creation

```bash
# Create alias record pointing to CloudFront
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z123456789 --change-batch '{
  "Changes": [{
    "Action": "CREATE",
    "ResourceRecordSet": {
      "Name": "quantumedge.com",
      "Type": "A",
      "AliasTarget": {
        "DNSName": "d123456789.cloudfront.net",
        "EvaluateTargetHealth": false,
        "HostedZoneId": "Z2FDTNDATAQYW2"
      }
    }
  }]
}'
```

#### 6.2 SSL Certificate Management

- Request ACM certificate for domain and www subdomain
- Validate certificate via DNS validation
- Configure automatic renewal

#### 6.3 Testing & Validation

- DNS propagation testing (dig, nslookup)
- SSL certificate validation
- Performance testing with GTmetrix/PageSpeed
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Security & Best Practices

### Security Implementation

- **IAM Policies**: Least privilege access control
- **Bucket Policies**: Granular S3 permissions
- **SSL/TLS**: End-to-end encryption
- **WAF Integration**: Application-layer protection
- **Access Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails

## Cost Optimisation

### Cost Optimisation Strategies

- S3 Intelligent Tiering for infrequently accessed content
- CloudFront reserved capacity for predictable traffic
- Lifecycle policies for log retention
- Regular cost monitoring with AWS Cost Explorer

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### CloudWatch Metrics

- Website availability and response times
- CloudFront cache hit ratios
- S3 request metrics and errors
- Route 53 query volumes

### Automated Monitoring

```bash
# CloudWatch alarm for website availability
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name "Website-Down" \
  --alarm-description "Website availability check" \
  --metric-name "HealthCheckStatus" \
  --namespace "AWS/Route53" \
  --statistic "Minimum" \
  --period 60 \
  --threshold 1 \
  --comparison-operator "LessThanThreshold"
```

## Scalability Considerations

### Traffic Scaling

- CloudFront automatically scales to handle traffic spikes
- S3 provides unlimited storage capacity
- Route 53 handles millions of DNS queries

### Geographic Expansion

- Multi-region S3 replication for disaster recovery
- CloudFront edge locations in 450+ cities
- Route 53 latency-based routing

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### DNS Propagation Delays

```bash
# Check DNS propagation status
dig quantumedge.com @8.8.8.8
nslookup quantumedge.com 1.1.1.1
```

#### SSL Certificate Issues

- Verify certificate covers both domain and www subdomain
- Check certificate validation status in ACM
- Ensure CloudFront distribution uses correct certificate

#### Performance Issues

- Analyse CloudFront cache hit ratios
- Optimise image sizes and formats
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Minify CSS and JavaScript files

#### Access Denied Errors

- Verify S3 bucket policy allows public read access
- Check CloudFront origin access identity configuration
- Validate IAM permissions for deployment user
